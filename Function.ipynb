        "->  Generators offer several significant advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets or potentially infinite sequences. Here's a breakdown of these advantages with an illustrative example:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of Generators:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memory Efficiency:** Generators produce values on demand (lazy evaluation), one at a time.  They don't store the entire sequence in memory. This is crucial when working with massive datasets that would otherwise consume excessive memory. Regular functions, especially those that return lists or other collections, often need to create the entire collection in memory before returning it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Improved Performance (for certain use cases):** Because generators produce values lazily, they can be faster if you don't need to process the entire sequence.  If you only need the first few items, the generator will only compute those, whereas a regular function creating a large list would compute everything even if you don't use it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simplified Code (for certain tasks):** Generators can make code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with complex iterations.  They allow you to express the logic of generating a sequence in a more straightforward way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ability to Represent Infinite Sequences:** Generators can be used to represent infinite sequences, as they only produce values as needed.  Regular functions cannot do this directly, as they would need to store the entire (infinite) sequence in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Processing a Large Log File\n",
